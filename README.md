Blue Menda Icon Themes
=================

This is a fork of the Menda Icon themes https://github.com/manjaro/menda-icon-themes

I really like the icons, but I find that the green theme clashes with my numix frost desktop, so I decided to recolor them.

This is the result of about an hour, hour and a half of work, and should take care of all the scalable green icons, I haven't changed the small ones yet.
